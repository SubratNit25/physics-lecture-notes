# About the Author

Subha is a postgraduate student of Physics with strong interests in
quantum mechanics, atomic physics, nuclear physics, and data-driven
approaches to physical systems.

These lecture notes were developed during MSc studies as part of a
long-term effort to build a coherent and conceptually clear resource
covering core areas of physics, with emphasis on physical insight,
mathematical structure, and connections across subfields.

The material reflects a learning-oriented perspective: derivations are
presented in full where they clarify ideas, while advanced topics are
motivated through physical reasoning rather than formalism alone.
Where relevant, links to modern research directions and computational
approaches are highlighted.

The notes are continuously evolving.
