## Why does a vibrating molecule have varying polarizability?

This is the *central physical idea* behind the Raman effect.

### What is polarizability physically?

The polarizability $\alpha$ of a molecule measures:

\begin{quote}
How easily the electronic cloud of a molecule is distorted by an external electric field.
\end{quote}

It is a property of the electronic distribution around the nuclei.

### Dependence of polarizability on nuclear coordinate

Consider a molecule undergoing vibration. During vibration:

\begin{itemize}
\item The internuclear distance changes continuously.
\item The electronic cloud adjusts to the instantaneous nuclear configuration.
\item Therefore, the electronic distribution changes with bond length.
\end{itemize}

Hence, the polarizability is not a constant but depends on the nuclear coordinate $Q$ describing the vibrational motion:
\[
\alpha = \alpha(Q).
\]

### Expansion for small vibrations

For small-amplitude vibrations about equilibrium ($Q = 0$), the polarizability can be expanded in a Taylor series:
\[
\alpha(Q) \approx \alpha_0 + \left(\frac{d\alpha}{dQ}\right)_{Q=0} Q.
\]

Defining
\[
\beta = \left(\frac{d\alpha}{dQ}\right)_{Q=0},
\]
we write
\[
\alpha(Q) = \alpha_0 + \beta Q.
\]

### Time dependence of the nuclear coordinate

For a harmonic vibrational mode, the nuclear coordinate varies sinusoidally with time:
\[
Q(t) = Q_0 \cos(2\pi \nu_m t),
\]
where $\nu_m$ is the molecular vibrational frequency.

Substituting $Q(t)$ into $\alpha(Q)$:
\[
\alpha(t) = \alpha_0 + \beta \cos(2\pi \nu_m t).
\]

\textbf{Important observations:}
\begin{itemize}
\item This time dependence of polarizability exists even in the absence of electromagnetic radiation.
\item It is purely a property of the vibrating molecule.
\item No scattering or emission occurs at this stage.
\end{itemize}

## Interaction with Incident Electromagnetic Radiation

Now let electromagnetic radiation of frequency $\nu_0$ be incident on the molecule.  
The electric field of the radiation is:
\[
E(t) = E_0 \cos(2\pi \nu_0 t).
\]

The induced dipole moment is given by:
\[
p(t) = \alpha(t) E(t).
\]

Substituting the expressions for $\alpha(t)$ and $E(t)$:
\[
p(t) = \left[\alpha_0 + \beta \cos(2\pi \nu_m t)\right] E_0 \cos(2\pi \nu_0 t).
\]

Using the identity
\[
\cos A \cos B = \frac{1}{2}\left[\cos(A+B) + \cos(A-B)\right],
\]
we obtain:
\begin{align}
p(t) = &\ \alpha_0 E_0 \cos(2\pi \nu_0 t) \\
& + \frac{1}{2}\beta E_0 \cos 2\pi (\nu_0 + \nu_m)t \\
& + \frac{1}{2}\beta E_0 \cos 2\pi (\nu_0 - \nu_m)t.
\end{align}

## Physical Interpretation

Since an oscillating dipole radiates electromagnetic waves, the three terms correspond to three types of scattered radiation:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Rayleigh scattering}: frequency $\nu_0$ (elastic scattering)
\item \textbf{Anti-Stokes Raman scattering}: frequency $\nu_0 + \nu_m$
\item \textbf{Stokes Raman scattering}: frequency $\nu_0 - \nu_m$
\end{itemize}

The Raman frequency shift depends only on the molecular vibrational frequency $\nu_m$, not on the incident frequency $\nu_0$.

## Key Conceptual Takeaways

\begin{itemize}
\item Raman effect originates from modulation of polarizability by nuclear motion.
\item Vibrational motion acts as a frequency modulator of the induced dipole.
\item A vibrational mode is Raman-active if $\dfrac{d\alpha}{dQ} \neq 0$.
\item Raman scattering can occur even in homonuclear molecules.
\item Rayleigh scattering is always the strongest component.
\end{itemize}
