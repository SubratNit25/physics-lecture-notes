## Classical Theory of Raman Effect

### Physical Origin

When a molecule is placed in an external electric field, the electronic cloud is distorted and an induced dipole moment is produced. The induced dipole moment $\vec{p}$ is proportional to the applied electric field $\vec{E}$:
\[
\vec{p} = \alpha \vec{E},
\]
where $\alpha$ is the electric polarizability of the molecule.

Molecules possess natural vibrational motion of nuclei about their equilibrium positions. Since the polarizability depends on the internuclear separation, molecular vibration causes the polarizability to vary with time.

### Why does a vibrating molecule have varying polarizability?  
*(Coordinate-dependent picture — key Raman idea)*

This is the **central physical reason** behind the Raman effect.

#### What is polarizability physically?

The polarizability $\alpha$ of a molecule tells us:

> How easily the electronic cloud of a molecule is distorted by an external electric field.

It is therefore a property of the **electronic distribution**, which in turn depends on the positions of the nuclei.

#### Dependence on nuclear coordinate

As a molecule vibrates:

- The internuclear distance changes continuously.
- The electronic cloud adjusts to the instantaneous nuclear configuration.
- Hence, the electronic distribution changes with bond length.

Therefore, the polarizability depends on the nuclear vibrational coordinate $Q$:
\[
\alpha = \alpha(Q).
\]

#### Small-amplitude vibration approximation

For small vibrations about equilibrium ($Q = 0$), we expand $\alpha(Q)$ in a Taylor series:
\[
\alpha(Q) \approx \alpha_0 + \left(\frac{d\alpha}{dQ}\right)_{Q=0} Q.
\]

Defining
\[
\beta = \left(\frac{d\alpha}{dQ}\right)_{Q=0},
\]
we write
\[
\alpha(Q) = \alpha_0 + \beta Q.
\]

#### Time dependence of the nuclear coordinate

For harmonic molecular vibration,
\[
Q(t) = Q_0 \cos(2\pi \nu_m t),
\]
where $\nu_m$ is the molecular vibrational frequency.

Substituting into $\alpha(Q)$:
\[
\alpha(t) = \alpha_0 + \beta \cos(2\pi \nu_m t).
\]

**Important conceptual points:**

- ✔️ This time dependence exists **even without any electromagnetic radiation**
- ✔️ It is a **pure molecular property**
- ✔️ No scattering occurs at this stage

### Time-Dependent Polarizability

For small-amplitude vibrations, the polarizability may be written as:
\[
\alpha(t) = \alpha_0 + \beta \cos(2\pi \nu_m t),
\]
where:
- $\alpha_0$ is the equilibrium polarizability,
- $\nu_m$ is the molecular vibrational frequency,
- $\beta = \left(\frac{d\alpha}{dQ}\right)_{Q=0}$ is the rate of change of polarizability with vibrational coordinate.

**Important:** Up to this stage, no electromagnetic radiation is involved.  
The molecule vibrates naturally with frequency $\nu_m$.

### Incident Electromagnetic Radiation

Let monochromatic electromagnetic radiation of frequency $\nu_0$ be incident on the molecule. The electric field of the radiation is:
\[
\vec{E}(t) = \vec{E}_0 \cos(2\pi \nu_0 t).
\]

This field induces a dipole moment:
\[
\vec{p}(t) = \alpha(t)\vec{E}(t).
\]

Substituting $\alpha(t)$ and $\vec{E}(t)$:
\[
\vec{p}(t) = \left[\alpha_0 + \beta \cos(2\pi \nu_m t)\right] E_0 \cos(2\pi \nu_0 t).
\]

### Frequency Components of the Induced Dipole

Using the identity
\[
\cos A \cos B = \frac{1}{2}\left[\cos(A+B) + \cos(A-B)\right],
\]
we obtain:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\vec{p}(t) =\;& \alpha_0 E_0 \cos(2\pi \nu_0 t) \\
& + \frac{1}{2}\beta E_0 \cos 2\pi (\nu_0 + \nu_m)t \\
& + \frac{1}{2}\beta E_0 \cos 2\pi (\nu_0 - \nu_m)t.
\end{aligned}
\]

### Interpretation of Scattered Radiation

Since an oscillating dipole radiates electromagnetic waves, the three frequency components correspond to:

- **Rayleigh scattering:** frequency $\nu_0$ (elastic)
- **Stokes Raman scattering:** frequency $\nu_0 - \nu_m$
- **Anti-Stokes Raman scattering:** frequency $\nu_0 + \nu_m$
