# Basic Ideas to Keep in Mind: Classical vs Quantum Description

## Motivation

Before developing the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics, it is
important to understand how quantum ideas differ from classical intuition.
This section summarizes the basic conceptual differences that should be kept in
mind throughout these notes.

---

## 1. Domain of Applicability

### Classical Mechanics (CM)

- Applicable to macroscopic systems
- Works when quantum effects are negligible
- Examples: projectiles, rigid bodies, planets, electrical circuits

### Quantum Mechanics (QM)

- Applicable to microscopic systems
- Required when classical mechanics fails
- Examples: electrons, atoms, nuclei, photons

---

## 2. Nature of Radiation and Matter

### Classical View

- Electromagnetic radiation has wave nature
- Matter has particle nature

This distinction works well at macroscopic scales.

### Quantum View

- Electromagnetic radiation exhibits wave–particle duality
- Matter also exhibits wave–particle duality

In quantum mechanics, the classical distinction between waves and particles
no longer holds.

---

## 3. Physical Observables

### Classical Mechanics

- Observables such as position, momentum, energy, and angular momentum
- Values are continuous
- The state of a system is specified by definite values of observables

### Quantum Mechanics

- Observables are represented by operators
- Measurement outcomes correspond to eigenvalues of operators
- Some observables have discrete spectra

Examples include energy levels of bound systems, angular momentum, and spin.

---

## 4. Important Clarification: Discrete vs Continuous

### Not all observables are discrete

Quantization is a key feature of quantum mechanics, but it is not universal.

- Discrete spectra:
  - Energy of bound states
  - Angular momentum
  - Spin

- Continuous spectra:
  - Position
  - Momentum
  - Energy of free particles

The nature of the spectrum depends on the operator, the physical system, and the
boundary conditions.

## 5. Conceptual Shift from Classical to Quantum Mechanics

| Classical Mechanics | Quantum Mechanics |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Definite trajectories | Probabilistic outcomes |
| Observables are numbers | Observables are operators |
| Deterministic evolution | Probabilistic measurement |
| Single nature (wave or particle) | Wave–particle duality |

---

## Key Takeaways

- Quantum mechanics is required for microscopic systems
- Matter and radiation both show wave–particle duality
- Observables are operator-valued quantities
- Quantization is selective, not universal
- Classical intuition must be revised, not discarded



## When Is a System Relativistic?

In quantum mechanics, classical mechanics, and relativistic physics, it is often
important to decide **whether relativistic effects are important or negligible**.
This section collects simple criteria that will be repeatedly used throughout
the course.

> This is not a complete discussion — these ideas will be refined and expanded
> as the course progresses.

---

## 1. Velocity-Based Criterion

- If the particle speed satisfies  
  \( v \ll c \),  
  the motion is **non-relativistic**.

- If the particle speed satisfies  
  \( v \sim c \),  
  the motion is **relativistic**.

This criterion is intuitive but **not always practical**, since velocity may
not be directly known in quantum problems.

---

## 2. Energy-Based Criterion (Most Useful)

Let \( m_0 c^2 \) denote the **rest mass energy** of the particle.

- If  
  \( \text{K.E.} \ll m_0 c^2 \),  
  the system is **non-relativistic**.

- If  
  \( \text{K.E.} \sim m_0 c^2 \)  
  or  
  \( \text{K.E.} > m_0 c^2 \),  
  the system is **relativistic**.

This criterion is widely used in quantum mechanics, nuclear physics, and
particle physics.

---

### Example 1: Electron

- Electron rest mass energy:  
  \( m_e c^2 \approx 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \)

1. **Electron with K.E. = 1 keV**
   - \( 1 \, \text{keV} \ll 511 \, \text{keV} \)
   - **Non-relativistic**

2. **Electron with K.E. = 1 MeV**
   - \( 1 \, \text{MeV} \sim 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \)
   - **Relativistic**

Thus, electrons become relativistic at energies of order **MeV**.

---

### Example 2: Proton

- Proton rest mass energy:  
  \( m_p c^2 \approx 938 \, \text{MeV} \)

- Proton with K.E. = 1 MeV:
  - \( 1 \, \text{MeV} \ll 938 \, \text{MeV} \)
  - **Non-relativistic**

This explains why protons can often be treated non-relativistically in atomic
and low-energy nuclear physics, while electrons cannot.

---

## 3. Momentum-Based Criterion

In many quantum problems, **momentum** is known rather than kinetic energy.

Compare the quantity \( p c \) with the rest mass energy \( m_0 c^2 \):

- If  
  \( p c \ll m_0 c^2 \),  
  the system is **non-relativistic**.

- If  
  \( p c \sim m_0 c^2 \)  
  or  
  \( p c > m_0 c^2 \),  
  the system is **relativistic**.

---

### Important Note on Units

Momentum \( p \) and rest mass energy \( m_0 c^2 \) **do not have the same units**.

- Always multiply momentum by \( c \)  
  → compare **\( p c \)** with **\( m_0 c^2 \)**

This puts both quantities in **energy units**, allowing a meaningful comparison.

---

## Summary of Relativistic Criteria

| Criterion | Non-relativistic | Relativistic |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| Velocity | \( v \ll c \) | \( v \sim c \) |
| Energy | \( \text{K.E.} \ll m_0 c^2 \) | \( \text{K.E.} \sim m_0 c^2 \) |
| Momentum | \( p c \ll m_0 c^2 \) | \( p c \sim m_0 c^2 \) |

---

### Conceptual Takeaway

- **Rest mass energy sets the scale**
- Relativity becomes important when available energy or momentum is comparable
  to \( m_0 c^2 \)
- These criteria will repeatedly guide approximations used later in the course
