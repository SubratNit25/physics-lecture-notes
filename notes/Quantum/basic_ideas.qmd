# Basic Ideas to Keep in Mind: Classical vs Quantum Description

## Motivation

Before developing the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics, it is
important to understand how quantum ideas differ from classical intuition.
This chapter collects a set of **basic guiding principles** that will be used
repeatedly throughout these notes.

These ideas are not meant to be complete or final; they will be refined and
extended as new concepts are introduced later in the course.

## 1. Domain of Applicability

### Classical Mechanics (CM)

- Applicable to **macroscopic systems**
- Works well when quantum effects are negligible
- Examples: projectiles, rigid bodies, planets, electrical circuits

### Quantum Mechanics (QM)

- Applicable to **microscopic systems**
- Required when classical mechanics fails
- Examples: electrons, atoms, nuclei, photons

At microscopic scales, classical concepts such as definite trajectories and
simultaneous measurement of all observables cease to be valid.

## 2. Nature of Radiation and Matter

### Classical View

- **Electromagnetic radiation**  
  → wave nature (Maxwell’s theory)

- **Matter**  
  → particle nature

This clear distinction is adequate at macroscopic scales.

### Quantum View

- **Electromagnetic radiation**  
  → wave–particle duality

- **Matter**  
  → wave–particle duality (de Broglie hypothesis)

In quantum mechanics, the sharp classical separation between waves and particles
is no longer meaningful.

---

## 3. Physical Observables

### Classical Mechanics

- Observables such as position, momentum, energy, and angular momentum
- Observables take **continuous values**
- The state of a system is specified by definite numerical values

### Quantum Mechanics

- Physical observables are represented by **operators**
- Measurement outcomes correspond to **eigenvalues** of operators
- Some observables exhibit **quantization**

Examples include energy levels of bound systems, angular momentum, and spin.

## 4. Important Clarification: Discrete vs Continuous

### Not all observables are discrete

Quantization is a defining feature of quantum mechanics, but it is **not
universal**.

- **Discrete spectra**:
  - Energy of bound states
  - Angular momentum
  - Spin

- **Continuous spectra**:
  - Position
  - Momentum
  - Energy of free particles

The nature of the spectrum depends on:
- the observable (operator),
- the physical system,
- and the boundary conditions.

## 5. Conceptual Shift from Classical to Quantum Mechanics

| Classical Mechanics | Quantum Mechanics |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Definite trajectories | Probabilistic outcomes |
| Observables are numbers | Observables are operators |
| Deterministic evolution | Probabilistic measurement |
| Single nature (wave or particle) | Wave–particle duality |

---

## Key Takeaways

- Quantum mechanics is required for microscopic systems
- Matter and radiation both exhibit wave–particle duality
- Observables are operator-valued quantities
- Quantization is selective, not universal
- Classical intuition must be revised, not discarded

## When Is a System Relativistic?

In many problems across quantum mechanics, atomic physics, nuclear physics, and
particle physics, it is important to decide **whether relativistic effects can
be neglected or must be included**.

This section summarizes simple criteria that will be used repeatedly throughout
the course.

> These criteria are preliminary and will be revisited in more formal settings
> later.

---

## 1. Velocity-Based Criterion

- If the particle speed satisfies  
  $v \ll c$,  
  the motion is **non-relativistic**.

- If the particle speed satisfies  
  $v \sim c$,  
  the motion is **relativistic**.

Although intuitive, this criterion is often impractical in quantum problems,
where velocity may not be directly known.

---

## 2. Energy-Based Criterion (Most Useful)

Let $m_0 c^2$ denote the **rest mass energy** of a particle.

- If  
  $\mathrm{K.E.} \ll m_0 c^2$,  
  the system is **non-relativistic**.

- If  
  $\mathrm{K.E.} \sim m_0 c^2$  
  or  
  $\mathrm{K.E.} > m_0 c^2$,  
  the system is **relativistic**.

This criterion is widely used in quantum mechanics, nuclear physics, and
particle physics.

---

### Example 1: Electron

Electron rest mass energy:
$$
m_e c^2 \approx 0.511\ \mathrm{MeV}
$$

- Electron with $\mathrm{K.E.} = 1\ \mathrm{keV}$  
  → $1\ \mathrm{keV} \ll 511\ \mathrm{keV}$  
  → **Non-relativistic**

- Electron with $\mathrm{K.E.} = 1\ \mathrm{MeV}$  
  → $1\ \mathrm{MeV} \sim 0.511\ \mathrm{MeV}$  
  → **Relativistic**

Thus, electrons become relativistic at energies of order **MeV**.

---

### Example 2: Proton

Proton rest mass energy:
$$
m_p c^2 \approx 938\ \mathrm{MeV}
$$

- Proton with $\mathrm{K.E.} = 1\ \mathrm{MeV}$  
  → $1\ \mathrm{MeV} \ll 938\ \mathrm{MeV}$  
  → **Non-relativistic**

This explains why protons can often be treated non-relativistically in atomic
and low-energy nuclear physics.

---

## 3. Momentum-Based Criterion

In many quantum problems, momentum is known more naturally than kinetic energy.

Compare the quantity $p c$ with the rest mass energy $m_0 c^2$:

- If  
  $p c \ll m_0 c^2$,  
  the system is **non-relativistic**.

- If  
  $p c \sim m_0 c^2$  
  or  
  $p c > m_0 c^2$,  
  the system is **relativistic**.

---

### Important Note on Units

Momentum $p$ and rest mass energy $m_0 c^2$ do **not** have the same units.

- Always multiply momentum by $c$
- Compare **$p c$** with **$m_0 c^2$**

This converts both quantities into energy units and allows a meaningful
comparison.

## Summary of Relativistic Criteria

| Criterion | Non-relativistic | Relativistic |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| Velocity | $v \ll c$ | $v \sim c$ |
| Energy | $\mathrm{K.E.} \ll m_0 c^2$ | $\mathrm{K.E.} \sim m_0 c^2$ |
| Momentum | $p c \ll m_0 c^2$ | $p c \sim m_0 c^2$ |

---

### Conceptual Takeaway

- **Rest mass energy sets the natural scale**
- Relativistic effects become important when available energy or momentum is
  comparable to $m_0 c^2$
- These criteria justify approximations used later in the course
