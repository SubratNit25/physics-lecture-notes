# Basic Ideas to Keep in Mind

## Motivation

Before developing the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics, it is
essential to clarify **how quantum descriptions differ from classical ones**.
This chapter introduces a set of **guiding ideas and scales** that will be used
throughout these notes.

These concepts are intentionally general. As the course progresses, they will
be refined, formalized, and applied in specific physical contexts.

## 1. Classical and Quantum Description of Nature

### 1.1 Domain of Applicability

**Classical Mechanics (CM)**

- Applicable to macroscopic systems
- Valid when quantum effects are negligible
- Examples: projectiles, rigid bodies, planetary motion, electrical circuits

**Quantum Mechanics (QM)**

- Applicable to microscopic systems
- Required when classical mechanics fails
- Examples: electrons, atoms, nuclei, photons

At microscopic scales, classical concepts such as definite trajectories and
simultaneous precise values of all observables lose their meaning.

---

### 1.2 Nature of Radiation and Matter

**Classical View**

- Electromagnetic radiation behaves as a wave
- Matter behaves as particles

This separation works well at macroscopic scales.

**Quantum View**

- Electromagnetic radiation exhibits wave–particle duality
- Matter also exhibits wave–particle duality

In quantum mechanics, the classical distinction between waves and particles is
no longer fundamental.

## 2. Observables and Measurement

### 2.1 Classical Observables

In classical mechanics:

- Observables such as position, momentum, energy, and angular momentum
  are represented by numbers
- These quantities take **continuous values**
- The state of a system is specified by definite values of all observables

---

### 2.2 Quantum Observables

In quantum mechanics:

- Physical observables are represented by **operators**
- Measurement outcomes correspond to **eigenvalues** of these operators
- The state of a system does not assign definite values to all observables
  simultaneously

---

### 2.3 Discrete and Continuous Spectra

A key feature of quantum mechanics is **quantization**, but it is important to
understand its limitations.

**Discrete spectra** occur for:
- Energy of bound states
- Angular momentum
- Spin

**Continuous spectra** occur for:
- Position
- Momentum
- Energy of free particles

The nature of the spectrum depends on:
- the observable,
- the physical system,
- and the boundary conditions.

> Quantization does not imply that all physical quantities are discrete.

## 3. Physical Scales and Approximations

Many physical theories are distinguished by the **energy and length scales**
at which they apply. Before choosing a theoretical description, it is important
to compare relevant physical quantities with natural reference scales.

### 3.1 When Is a System Relativistic?

Relativistic effects become important when particle energies or momenta are
comparable to the particle’s rest mass energy.

This section summarizes practical criteria used throughout quantum mechanics,
atomic physics, and nuclear physics.

---

### 3.2 Velocity-Based Criterion

If the particle speed satisfies

$$
v \ll c ,
$$

the motion is **non-relativistic**.

If the particle speed satisfies

$$
v \sim c ,
$$

the motion is **relativistic**.

Although intuitive, this criterion is often impractical in quantum problems,
where velocity may not be directly known.

---

### 3.3 Energy-Based Criterion (Most Useful)

Let the rest mass energy of a particle be

$$
m_0 c^2 .
$$

- If

$$
\mathrm{K.E.} \ll m_0 c^2 ,
$$

the system is **non-relativistic**.

- If

$$
\mathrm{K.E.} \sim m_0 c^2
\quad \text{or} \quad
\mathrm{K.E.} > m_0 c^2 ,
$$

the system is **relativistic**.

---

#### Example: Electron

The electron rest mass energy is

$$
m_e c^2 \approx 0.511\ \mathrm{MeV} .
$$

- Electron with kinetic energy $1\ \mathrm{keV}$:

$$
1\ \mathrm{keV} \ll 511\ \mathrm{keV}
$$

→ Non-relativistic

- Electron with kinetic energy $1\ \mathrm{MeV}$:

$$
1\ \mathrm{MeV} \sim 0.511\ \mathrm{MeV}
$$

→ Relativistic

Thus, electrons become relativistic at energies of order MeV.

---

#### Example: Proton

The proton rest mass energy is

$$
m_p c^2 \approx 938\ \mathrm{MeV} .
$$

For a proton with kinetic energy $1\ \mathrm{MeV}$:

$$
1\ \mathrm{MeV} \ll 938\ \mathrm{MeV}
$$

→ Non-relativistic

This explains why protons are often treated non-relativistically in atomic and
low-energy nuclear physics.

---

### 3.4 Momentum-Based Criterion

In many quantum problems, momentum is known more naturally than kinetic energy.

To assess relativistic effects, compare

$$
p c
$$

with the rest mass energy

$$
m_0 c^2 .
$$

- If

$$
p c \ll m_0 c^2 ,
$$

the system is **non-relativistic**.

- If

$$
p c \sim m_0 c^2
\quad \text{or} \quad
p c > m_0 c^2 ,
$$

the system is **relativistic**.

---

### Important Note on Units

Momentum $p$ and rest mass energy $m_0 c^2$ do **not** have the same units.

To compare them meaningfully:

$$
\text{always compare } p c \text{ with } m_0 c^2 .
$$

Multiplying momentum by $c$ converts it into energy units.

## Summary of Key Ideas

- Quantum mechanics is required for microscopic systems
- Matter and radiation both exhibit wave–particle duality
- Observables are represented by operators
- Not all observables are discrete
- Rest mass energy sets the natural scale for relativistic effects
- These criteria justify approximations used later in the course
